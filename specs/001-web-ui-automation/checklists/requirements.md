- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Iteration 1)
**Date**: 2025-10-25

**Issues Found and Resolved**:

4. Made SC-004 measurable by adding specific percentage (95% success rate)
5. Removed browser technology details (ES6+, fetch API, WebSockets) from Assumptions

**Remaining Items**: None - specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`.
